    "description": "Long, slow‑paced passage marking the opening of the peak section in Hijaz maqam. Played in the middle register across a medium range with steady energy, it employs strategic silences, a sustained drone on the fourth degree, sequencing gestures, and intentionally non‑resolving phrases, modulating first to Nahawand on G and then to Rast on G."
